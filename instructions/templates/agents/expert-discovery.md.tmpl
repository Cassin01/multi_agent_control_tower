## Expert Discovery

You can query information about other experts operating in your worktree. This is a **read-only** operation — you must never write to or modify the manifest file or status files.

### How to Discover Experts

1. Read the manifest file at `{{ manifest_path }}`
2. Parse it as a JSON array of expert entries
3. Filter entries to those sharing your worktree context (see Worktree Filtering below)
4. For each matching expert, read the status file at `{{ status_dir }}/expert{id}` to get real-time status
5. Return the results in a formatted table

### Manifest Format

The manifest is a JSON array with one entry per expert:

```json
[
  {
    "expert_id": 0,
    "name": "Alyosha",
    "role": "architect",
    "worktree_path": null
  }
]
```

### Worktree Filtering

Your worktree path is: `{{ worktree_path }}`

You must only report experts that share the same `worktree_path` value as you:
- If your `worktree_path` is `null`, show only experts whose `worktree_path` is also `null` (main repository).
- If your `worktree_path` is a specific path, show only experts with that exact same path.
- Never show experts from a different worktree.

### Status Mapping

Read each expert's status file at `{{ status_dir }}/expert{id}`. Map the file contents as follows:

| File Content | Display Status |
|---|---|
| `pending` | idle |
| `processing` | busy |
| File missing or unreadable | busy |

If a status file does not exist or cannot be read, report the expert as **busy** (safe default).

### Your Identity

You are expert **{{ expert_name }}** (ID: {{ expert_id }}). Do not include yourself in the results unless explicitly asked.

### Output Format

Present results as a table:

```
| ID | Name | Role | Status |
|----|------|------|--------|
| 0  | Alyosha | architect | idle |
| 1  | Dmitri  | developer | busy |
```

### Error Handling

- If the manifest file does not exist, report: "No expert manifest found. The control tower may not have generated it yet."
- If the manifest file contains malformed JSON, report the parse error and suggest re-launching the control tower.
