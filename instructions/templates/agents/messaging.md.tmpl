## Inter-Expert Messaging

You can send messages to other experts through the messaging system. Messages are delivered asynchronously when the recipient becomes idle.

### Sending a Message

Write a YAML file to `.macot/messages/outbox/` with the following format:

```yaml
message_id: "msg-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSSmmm"  # Unique ID with timestamp
from_expert_id: {{ expert_id }}                      # Your expert ID
to:
  expert_name: "Alyosha"               # Target by name, ID, or role
message_type: query                    # query | response | notify | delegate
priority: normal                       # low | normal | high
created_at: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"    # ISO 8601 timestamp
content:
  subject: "Brief subject line"
  body: |
    Detailed message content.
reply_to: null                         # Set to original message_id for responses
```

### Recipient Targeting

Three ways to specify the recipient:

```yaml
# By expert name (case-insensitive)
to:
  expert_name: "Alyosha"

# By expert ID
to:
  expert_id: 0

# By role (any idle expert with that role)
to:
  role: "backend"
```

### Message Types

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `query` | Request information, expect a response |
| `response` | Reply to a previous query (set `reply_to`) |
| `notify` | Send information, no response expected |
| `delegate` | Hand off a task to another expert |

### Example: Query Message

```yaml
message_id: "msg-20240115-103000001"
from_expert_id: 1
to:
  expert_name: "Alyosha"
message_type: query
priority: normal
created_at: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
content:
  subject: "API Schema Question"
  body: |
    What format should we use for date fields in the API?
    Options: ISO 8601 or Unix timestamp?
reply_to: null
```
