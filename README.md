## ✨ Features

- **⚡ Parallel orchestration**: run multiple experts concurrently in isolated tmux panes.
- **🧠 Role-based execution**: assign experts like `architect`, `planner`, `general`, and `debugger`.
- **🤖 Automated feature execution**: run task batches from spec files automatically.
- **📨 Async inter-expert messaging**: deliver queued messages to available experts.
- **🖥️ Control Tower TUI**: dispatch tasks, monitor status, and review reports in one screen.
- **🌲 Worktree-friendly flow**: reduce branch conflicts with isolated workspaces per expert.
- **🧩 Configurable by design**: tune experts, roles, timeouts, and paths via YAML.
- **🔒 Local-first runtime**: queue and context live locally with no external coordinator service.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Install, launch, and verify in under a minute.

```bash
# 0) Prerequisites: rust + tmux + Claude CLI
cargo install macot

# 1) Launch session + TUI in one step
macot launch
```

Or, if you prefer separate steps:

```bash
# 1) Start a session in your current project
macot start .

# 2) Open the control tower
macot tower

# 3) Verify from another terminal
macot status
```

Success looks like:

- session name appears as `macot-<hash>`
- at least one expert moves to `Thinking` or `Executing`
- a report appears in the tower report list

## ⚙️ Configuration

Use YAML config when you need custom experts, roles, or runtime timeouts.

```yaml
experts:
  - name: Linda
    role: architect
  - name: James
    role: planner
  - name: John
    role: general
  - name: Sarah
    role: debugger

runtime:
  startup_timeout_seconds: 30
  graceful_shutdown_timeout_seconds: 10

paths:
  instructions_dir: ./instructions
```

```bash
macot start -c ./config/macot.yaml
macot tower --config ./config/macot.yaml
```

## ❓ FAQ

### Where are session artifacts stored?

Inside your project at `.macot/`.

### How do agents communicate with each other?

Use the built-in async messaging queue. Each expert can send messages through a dedicated messaging subagent, and those messages are created as YAML files in `.macot/messages/outbox/` and routed automatically to matching experts (by id, name, or role) when recipients are idle, so a `debugger` expert can report a root cause and delegate the fix to a `backend` expert.

### How do I run tasks automatically from a spec?

In the tower Task Input, enter a feature name (for example `auth-refactor`) and press `Ctrl+G`.
`<feature>-tasks.md` is created by the `planner` expert, and `<feature>-design.md` is created by the `architect` expert.  
macot will execute tasks from `.macot/specs/<feature>-tasks.md` in batches (and also references `.macot/specs/<feature>-design.md` when present).
